# Polymarket Live Executor

Execute real trades on Polymarket with mandatory human-in-the-loop confirmation.
This skill requires L2 authentication (wallet private key) and enforces strict
safety controls on every operation.

## SAFETY REQUIREMENTS

**Every trade requires explicit user confirmation.** The agent must:

1. Display full trade details (market, side, size, price, estimated cost)
2. Show current order book context (spread, depth at target price)
3. Wait for the user to type "yes" or "confirm" before proceeding
4. Never batch or auto-confirm trades

**Environment safeguards** (enforced by all scripts):
- `POLYMARKET_PRIVATE_KEY` must be set (burner wallet only -- NEVER a main wallet)
- `POLYMARKET_CONFIRM=true` must be set to enable any trade execution
- Position size hard-capped (default $10, configurable via `POLYMARKET_MAX_SIZE`)
- Daily loss limit tracked in `~/.polymarket-live/trades.log`

## Setup

Before using this skill, the user must:

1. Create a burner wallet (see `references/security.md`)
2. Fund it with a small amount of USDC on Polygon
3. Set environment variables:
   ```bash
   export POLYMARKET_PRIVATE_KEY="0x..."    # Burner wallet only!
   export POLYMARKET_CONFIRM=true           # Safety gate
   export POLYMARKET_MAX_SIZE=10            # Max $ per trade (default: 10)
   export POLYMARKET_DAILY_LOSS_LIMIT=50    # Max daily loss (default: 50)
   ```
4. Review the `references/live-trading-checklist.md` before any live trade

## Available Scripts

### 1. Execute Trade (`scripts/execute_live.py`)

Place a real order on Polymarket.

```bash
# Limit order: buy 5 YES shares at $0.60
python scripts/execute_live.py --token-id <ID> --side BUY --size 5 --price 0.60

# Market order: buy $5 worth at market price
python scripts/execute_live.py --token-id <ID> --side BUY --amount 5 --market

# Sell: sell 10 shares at $0.75
python scripts/execute_live.py --token-id <ID> --side SELL --size 10 --price 0.75
```

The script will display full trade details and require interactive confirmation.

### 2. Check Positions (`scripts/check_positions.py`)

View wallet balance, open orders, and trade history.

```bash
python scripts/check_positions.py                # Summary
python scripts/check_positions.py --orders        # Open orders
python scripts/check_positions.py --trades        # Recent trades
python scripts/check_positions.py --balance       # USDC balance
```

## Workflow

1. Run analysis with polymarket-analyzer scripts to find opportunities
2. Paper-trade the idea with polymarket-paper-trader first
3. Review `references/live-trading-checklist.md`
4. Set up environment variables and burner wallet
5. Use `check_positions.py` to verify wallet state
6. Execute trade with `execute_live.py` -- confirm when prompted
7. Monitor position with `check_positions.py`

## Risk Controls

- All trades logged to `~/.polymarket-live/trades.log`
- Daily P&L tracked and enforced against loss limit
- Position size caps prevent oversized trades
- No autonomous execution -- every trade needs human approval

## Important Disclaimers

- This skill executes REAL trades with REAL money
- Use only with burner wallets funded with money you can afford to lose
- Past analysis does not guarantee future results
- Not financial advice -- you are solely responsible for your trades
